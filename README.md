NEO Explorer
NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024: Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects
NEO Explorer is an interactive web application developed as part of the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge. The goal of this project is to provide a visually engaging and educational tool that allows users to explore Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), such as asteroids and comets, along with other celestial bodies in our solar system.

Project Overview
NEO Explorer offers an immersive and interactive 3D environment where users can visualize celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids. Users can select specific date ranges and explore real-time or historical data on NEOs, complete with zoom-ins and pop-ups for additional information.

This project aims to educate the public about NEOs and raise awareness of the potential impact hazards posed by asteroids.

Features
3D visualizations of celestial bodies using Three.js
Interactive pop-ups displaying detailed NEO information
Zoom-in functionality for closer inspection of asteroids and planets
Date range selector to explore NEO data across specific time frames
Real-time and historical data on NEOs sourced from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) Data
Educational tool that informs users about the solar system and potential hazards
Development Tools
Three.js: For rendering 3D celestial bodies and NEOs
