NEO Explorer is an interactive web application developed for the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge, designed to allow users to explore Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and other celestial bodies in a visually engaging and educational manner. The project features 3D visualizations of planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, all rendered using Three.js. Users can interact with the app through zoom-ins, pop-ups displaying detailed information, and a date range selector that enables exploration of both real-time and historical NEO data from NASAâ€™s Near-Earth Object (NEO) Data. The app serves as an educational tool, aiming to raise awareness about the solar system and potential asteroid hazards.

The development involved core web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsive design, alongside Visual Studio Code as the code editor, Git for version control, and Vercel for hosting the live version of the project. We also utilized a free domain provided by NASA Global Offers from GoDaddy, and connected it to a custom domain registered via Porkbun. Resources such as NASA's Eyes on Solar Systems, Eyes on Asteroids, and Pixabay were instrumental in providing data, visuals, and educational content for the app. By leveraging NASA APIs and data, this project provides an engaging, interactive experience that educates the public about the solar system and the significance of monitoring NEOs.

Our team consists of Prudvi Kumar Reddy (Team Leader), Akhila V (Team Member I), Ankit Sharma (Backend Engineer), and Shreya Patel (UI/UX Designer), and we have collaborated effectively to create this project using modern tools and technologies. The app can be accessed live on Vercel via our custom domain, providing a polished, professional platform for users to explore NEOs.
